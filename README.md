## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer who works for Red Hat in the virtualization engineering
group. My primary focus areas are Confidential computing, QEMU, KVM, libvirt
and open source cloud virtualization tools like cloud-init, Microsoft WALA agent,
hyperv-daemons etc. I have worked in Canada for various companies after completion
of my masters program at the University of British Columbia there. My Red Hat
